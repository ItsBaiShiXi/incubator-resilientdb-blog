# What is ResMark?

ResView is a Geolocation-based Attendance and Quiz Monitoring System using ResilientDB and ResVault. In order to provide a secure and tamper-proof method of tracking studentâ€™s attendance and the submission of quizzes in educational institutions, this system merges geofencing and blockchain technology. The project makes the use of HTML5 Geolocation and JavaScript to get the coordinates of Class Location and verify if the Client request (in our case Students) is coming from the class - we have set a proximity of 50 meters from the class coordinate and if the user lies inside that set perimeter then only they will be able to mark their attendance and can be redirected to give the quiz. This method ensures fairness because the student will only be able to mark attendance and give Quiz when they are present in the class.

Below is a diagram showing the architecture of ResMark and the high-level structure:

</p>

The diagram above shows the overall architecture of ResMark and the way various services interact with each other. The user can be either the Student or Professor. Users will login to the system using ResVault. ResVault is used to authenticate and let the user into the system. The request is then sent from the user's browser to the GraphQL server which communicates with ResilientDB using the Resilient JS SDK. ResilientDB is used as the primary blockchain to store the public key and transaction details having attendance, quiz answers. MongoDB is used as a second database for custom indexing. The server interacts with MongoDB for data fetching and adding. To allow the sync between MondoDB and Resilient DB, the resilient-node-cache package is used.

Below Flowchart shows overall flow of the application with both Admin (Professor) and User (Student) flow.

## Technology stack
Web Application: ReactJS, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
Backend: NodeJS, ExpressJS, Python, GraphQL
Database: ResilientDB (blockchain), MongoDB, resilient-node-cache (package for syncing)
APIs: HTML5 Geolocation API
## Authentication with ResVault

## Marking Attendance

    <br>
    <em>Figure 6. Displaying the screenshot of the mark attendance page when student cannot mark attendance outside of the class boundaries
    </em>
</p>

Students can mark attendance only when they are physically present in the class. Their location must be within the classroom bounds.

## Attempting the Quiz

Page loads only if the student is present within the class boundaries.

Shows the overall status of all the quizzes taken by the student, courses registered and the attendance in classes along with the score.

# Running the Application

## Prerequisites

Before running the ResMark application, you need to start KV service on the ResDB backend and the SDK.

### resilientdb
Git clone the resilientDB repository and follow the instructions to set it up:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb
```
Setup KV Service:
```bash
./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service.sh
```

### sdk
Git clone the GraphQL Repository and follow the instructions on the ReadMe to set it up:

Install GraphQL:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ResilientApp/ResilientDB-GraphQL
```

Setup SDK:
```bash
bazel build service/http_server:crow_service_main

bazel-bin/service/http_server/crow_service_main service/tools/config/interface/client.config service/http_server/server_config.config
```

### ResVault

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb-resvault
```

Steps -
1. Generate the build file
2. Enable developr mode and unpack the build file in chrome extensions.
3. Register on ResVault

## Running the ResMark Application

Clone the repo and open it in a new folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/preyashyadav/resmark-v1/
```

For syncing between ResDB and mongoDB package called resilient-node-cache. 
To install this -
```bash
npm i resilient-node-cache
```

Install other dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Run the below code to start the app and load the script.
```bash
npm start
```

# Future Work

Integration with University Schedule Builder - ResMark can be integrated with the university's Schedule Builder app to automatically retrieve class locations and course schedules of the student.
Canvas Integration - ResMark can be further integrated with Canvas or similar LMS platforms to directly post quiz grades and attendance records, ensuring real-time updates and accessibility for both students and instructors.
Mobile Application Development - ResMark can be expanded to develop a mobile application for on-the-go access, allowing students and professors to interact seamlessly with the platform via their smartphones.
