**Powered by the robust ResilientDB fabric, ResIdentity secures critical files with a tamper-proof signing process, ensuring heightened protection and verifiable integrity for crucial documents.**<!-- excerpt end -->

# Project Overview
## Background
**What ResIdentity Does** \
ResIdentity is a document signing application that allows users to securely login and upload PDF documents for signing. Once a document is signed, the application stores the hash of the signed PDF on the secure, blockchain-based ResilientDB fabric ensuring that each document's signature is verifiable and cannot be altered. Users can then download their signed PDFs. By directly recording each signature's details on the blockchain, ResIdentity provides a tamper-proof ledger of transactions, which enhances the verifiability and reliability of document signing.

## Motivation
**Why Did We Build ResIdentity?** \
Centralized document signing platforms are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, with hackers targeting central servers to steal or alter sensitive documents and credentials. Additionally, any failure in the central server can cause significant service disruptions and downtime. Such platforms also raise privacy concerns as they limit users' control over their own data, with all management and security protocols handled by the service provider.

## What Sets Us Apart
ResIdentity utilizes ResilientDB to store document hashes on a blockchain, making each signature tamper-proof and verifiable. This decentralized approach eliminates single points of failure, enhancing reliability and reducing risks of data manipulation. Blockchain's inherent transparency allows for secure, auditable records without compromising privacy, providing a dependable and user-empowered alternative to centralized document signing.

# Feature Set
## User Registration and Login
Faciliates simple and secure user onboarding and sign-in.

## Upload, Sign and Download PDFs
In just a few clicks, users can easily upload PDFs, apply their digital signatures and download signed PDFs.

## Verify Signed PDFs
Users can verify whether a particular signed PDF was signed via the ResIdentity application by matching the uploaded file hash with a corresponding signing record on the underlying ResilientDB blockchain.

# User Guide
## Setup
**Dependencies:**
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), [ResilientDB]()

- To build, run:
```
docker compose build
```
- To launch ResIdentity, run:
```
docker compose up -d
```
- To launch ResilientDB's KV Service, run:
```
docker exec -it resid-core-backend bash
/bin/sh ./INSTALL.sh
/bin/sh ./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service.sh
```
To verify the status of KV Service, run:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"id":"key1","value":"value1"}' 127.0.0.1:18000/v1/transactions/commit
curl 127.0.0.1:18000/v1/transactions/key1
```
- The server should be running on ```http://localhost:3000/```.\
Visit ```http://localhost:8000/api``` to verify the API.
